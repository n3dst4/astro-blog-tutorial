          <p>
            Neil got roped into a red-box D&D game one rainy lunchtime at
            school in the 1980s and never quite got over it. TTRPGs have been
            a constant in his life ever since.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>But</em> it turns out he had more than one nerdish obsession,
            and the other one, computers, offered better pay. So he bounced
            around bunch of roles (sysadmin, tech writer, graphic designer)
            before becoming a full-time developer in the mid-noughties.
          </p>
          <p>
            He&apos;s been a professional developer ever since, working with
            startups and established companies alike, and has never stopped
            playing TTRPGs.
          </p>
          <p>Neil lives with his wife Jade, and two cats.</p>

            Jade has never played a single TTRPG in her entire life, but she
            has many useful skills, including putting up with Neil,
            proofreading, and admin.

            <mark>The cats, Grigio and Romana</mark>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Grigio (left, fluffy, one braincell) and Romana (right, shorthair,
            too smart) are both rescues from UAE. Grigio was dumped in a car
            park and Romana was abandoned in the lobby of an apartment block
            for days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Romana and Grigio now live with each other and two human servants.
          </p>
